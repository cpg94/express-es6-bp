# Express ES6 Boilerplate.

Simple Express ES6 boilerplate, built with [Noderize](https://noderize.js.org/). Includes handy tool to create and delete routes through a CLI too! 😄


## Getting Started.

Install dependencies, in root project folder run:

> yarn

To start development server, run - (this will start server at localhost:3000):
> yarn watch

To build for production:
> yarn build

## CLI tools.

I've added a couple of CLI tools to help create/delete controllers. These create new controller files and also add the routes to your app!

To create run:
>yarn create-controller

To delete run:
>yarn delete-controller

**You can only delete controllers that you've added through CLI!**

Have fun! 😎
